Very impressive codes forked from [uPIT-for-speech-sepration](https://github.com/funcwj/uPIT-for-speech-separation)
, check the information therein

Make changes to perform target speaker separation using a short adaptation utterance based on the work in [1] speaker adaptive neural layer and [2] learning hidden unit contribution (LHUC)

results to be updated
